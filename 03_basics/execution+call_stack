                                        Javascript Execution Context
# Three types of execution context

{} - Global EC - (this)

Function Execution Context

Eval Execution Context

-----------------------------------------------------

# Steps followed during execution environment creation

1. Global Execution - (this)
2. Memory Phase
   undefined assigned to variables and definition to functions

3. Execution Phase
   values assigned to variables
   functions create a separate execution context for themselves - (new variable environment + execution thread 
   i.e. Memory Phase and Execution Phase will be created again for the function)
   
   returning values will start from innermost execution context and continue till final return to global context

   also, after return execution context is deleted


# Call - Stack 

  Global Execution is at at the bottom of Stack
  subsequent method calls are stored on top of it
  they are popped out in LIFO strategy 
  Global is popped at last
